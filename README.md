## Introduction

Envoy proxy is an open-source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. It is widely used in modern microservices architectures and service mesh implementations.

Envoy is built to be highly performant and extensible, with features like dynamic service discovery, load balancing, TLS termination, HTTP/2 and gRPC proxying, circuit breaking, retries, rate limiting, observability, and more. It is often deployed as a sidecar alongside each service instance in a microservices architecture, facilitating communication between services and providing various traffic management functionalities.
